Hello World
My name is Andrew. I am attempting to start from the ground up to teach myself how to be a web developer. I will be using GitHUb in combination with other various free recourses and/or low fee resources available to me to enable to me to become proficient enough to land a job and hopefully, eventually, a full time career.
